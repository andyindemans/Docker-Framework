# Workspace

This is where you can put scripts, Python programs, etc.

When you have added a script, program,... here, you can create a bash script in the Commands root folder.
```bash
Commands/bin
```

these bash scripts will be accessible and loaded into the Docker containers on startup, so these scripts/programs can be ran at all times via a useful shortcut.
